Code (and Data) for the paper "EEG Decoding Reveals Distinct Processes for Directing Spatial Attention and Encoding into Working Memory"

The paper (available here (link forthcoming)) uses two experiments and a suite of machine learning methods (IEMs, decoding, RSA) to reveal dissociations between spatial attention, and the number of items maintained in work


The code is available on [github](https://github.com/henrymj/DissociatingWMLoadFromSpatialAttention)

The code and data are available on OSF (link forthcoming)

Each experiment contains its own README (and sub READMEs) talking through the directory structure.
