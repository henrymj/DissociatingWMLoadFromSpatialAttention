Both directories `1a` and `1b` contain the same structure.

`Experiment` contains the code for running the experiment.

Raw data is available at OSF (see highlevel README) at `/Exp1*_RawData`.

`Analyses` contains 4 subfolders:  
1. `Analysis_ARF` runs artifact rejection  
2. `Analysis_BEH` compares behavior across the conditions  
3. `Analysis_MVL` runs the decoding analyses  
4. `Analysis_POW` runs the alpha power analyses  

There may be references to `EEGData`.  
For `Analysis_MVL`, this is available at `Exp1*_processedData/EEGData`.  
for `Analysis_MVL`, this is available at `Exp1*_processedData/alphaPower`.  

`Exp1*_processedData` also contains 4 `.mat` files contains the decoding results, and 1 `.mat` file containing the grand alpha power across participants.
