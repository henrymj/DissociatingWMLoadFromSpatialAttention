Both directories `1a` and `1b` contain the same structure.

`Experiment` contains the code for running the experiment.

`Data` contains the raw data and its reformatted versions.

`Analyses` contains 4 subfolders:  
1. `Analysis_ARF` runs artifact rejection  
2. `Analysis_BEH` compares behavior across the conditions  
3. `Analysis_MVL` runs the decoding analyses  
4. `Analysis_POW` runs the alpha power analyses  

There may be references to `EEGData`. These are copies of the folder under `Analysis_ARF`, and are excluded to save space.
